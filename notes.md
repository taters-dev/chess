## Development Notes

### Monday, Jan 12

#### First Commit
Read through the project files and I feel the most logical place to start is
with ChessPosition.java because it is needed for all the rest of the classes.

<span style="color: green;">[Passed test cases]</span> ChessPosition.java - 1/12 7:35 pm<br>

- Simple Constructor and Getter methods
- Struggled at first with overriding equals() and hashCode() however after reading the tips from the course github it was fine.
